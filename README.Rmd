This repository contains code to animate caribou movement relative to fire hotspots in Northwest Territories (NWT) from the 2023 fire season. Caribou data comes from the Government of Northwest Territories' woodland caribou data on Movebank. Fire data comes from Natural Resources Canada fire hotspots [datasets](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/datamart).  

### Project organization
The project folder structure is as follows:
``` src
-- caribou_fires_NWT
  |-- data
      |-- raw
          |-- CanadaPoly
          |-- cwfis
          |-- FireShapefiles
      |-- derived
  |-- scripts
  |-- anims
```

The `data` folder contains `raw` data from the source, and the `derived` data that were prepared for the animations. `CanadaPoly` contains a polygon of Canadian provinces and territories from [Statistics Canada](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/geo/sip-pis/boundary-limites/index2021-eng.cfm?year=21) to filter data to NWT. `cwfis` contains the NRCan fires [data](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/datamart). The `FireShapefiles` data were provided by GNWT.

The `scripts` folder contains the R code necessary to prepare and animate the data in numerical order. There are two separate scripts that create the animations. One using the `basemaps` package for the base map and another using `ggmap` for the base map depending on needs for future use. The `basemaps` version is the one that created 2023 deliverables. The `anims` folder is where the animations will be saved.
