This repository contains code to animate caribou movement relative to
fire hotspots in Northwest Territories (NWT) from the 2023 fire season.
Caribou data comes from the Government of Northwest Territoriesâ€™
woodland data on movebank. Fire data comes from Natural Resources Canada
fire hotspots [dataset](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/datamart).

### Project organization

The project folder structure is as follows:

``` src
-- caribou_fires_NWT
  |-- data
      |-- raw
          |-- CanadaPoly
          |-- cwfis
          |-- FireShapefiles
      |-- derived
  |-- scripts
  |-- anims
```

The `data` folder contains `raw` data from the source, and the `derived`
data that was prepared for the animations. `CanadaPoly` contains a
polygon of Canadian provinces and territories from [Statistics
Canada](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/geo/sip-pis/boundary-limites/index2021-eng.cfm?year=21)
to filter data to NWT. `cwfis` contains the NRCan fires
[data](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/datamart). The `FireShapefiles`
data was provided by GNWT.

The `scripts` folder contains the R code necessary to prepare and
animate the data in numerical order. The `anims` folder is where the
animations will be saved.
